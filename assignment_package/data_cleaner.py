    This function receives a Pandas DataFrame as input.

    First, pass the input DataFrame `df` to the `missing_values_cleaner`
    function, and store its output in a new variable called `clean`.
    Then, pass `clean` to the `quantity_handler` function and store its
    output (you may reuse the variable name `clean`).

    Next, pass the resulting DataFrame to the `amount_spent_computer`
    function, and then to the `date_handler` function. Finally, return
    the fully cleaned DataFrame.
